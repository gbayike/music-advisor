summary: "<p>Modern world spoils us with a wide variety of music: pop-lovers, rockers,\
  \ rappers and club enthusiasts alike face a nearly infinite choice. Fortunately,\
  \ there are programs that can help us find something we like and not get lost in\
  \ this variety: in this project, you will write a program like this. Create a personal\
  \ music advisor that makes preference-based suggestions and even shares links to\
  \ new releases and featured playlists. Together with Spotify, your music advisor\
  \ will be a powerful guide to the world of music.</p>"
